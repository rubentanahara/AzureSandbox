# Laptop Performance Troubleshooting

## Common Performance Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Slow Startup

**Causes and Solutions:**

#### 1. Too many startup programs
- Windows: Open Task Manager > Startup tab
- Disable unnecessary programs
- Keep only: Antivirus, VPN client, essential business apps

#### 2. Pending updates
- Check Windows Update
- Install all pending updates
- Restart computer

#### 3. Disk space low
- Minimum 20% free space required
- Run Disk Cleanup: cleanmgr
- Clear temp files, browser cache
- Move large files to network storage

### Issue: Computer Running Slow

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check CPU/Memory usage in Task Manager
2. Identify resource-intensive processes
3. Close unnecessary applications

**Common Culprits:**
- Browser with too many tabs (> 20 tabs)
- Multiple video conferencing apps running
- Large Excel files or data processing
- Antivirus full system scan

**Solutions:**
- Close unused applications
- Restart computer (clears memory)
- Add more RAM if usage consistently > 90% (submit hardware request)
- Upgrade to SSD if still using HDD

### Issue: High Disk Usage

**Solutions:**
1. Disable Windows Search indexing temporarily
2. Check for malware scan running
3. Disable Superfetch service (for HDDs)
4. Run disk check: chkdsk /f /r

### Issue: Overheating/Fan Noise

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure vents are not blocked
2. Clean air vents (use compressed air)
3. Use laptop on hard surface, not soft surfaces
4. Check if running resource-intensive tasks
5. Submit hardware request if issue persists

### Issue: Battery Draining Quickly

**Solutions:**
1. Check battery health: powercfg /batteryreport
2. Reduce screen brightness
3. Close power-hungry applications
4. Disable Bluetooth/WiFi when not needed
5. Use Power Saver mode
6. Replace battery if health < 70% (submit hardware request)

## Preventive Maintenance

- Restart computer at least weekly
- Keep disk space above 20% free
- Run Windows Update regularly
- Close applications when not in use
- Limit browser tabs to < 20

## Performance Optimization

1. Disable visual effects: System > Advanced > Performance Settings
2. Disable unnecessary background apps
3. Clear browser cache regularly
4. Uninstall unused programs
5. Disable OneDrive sync for large folders not needed offline

## When to Request New Hardware

- Computer is > 4 years old
- RAM consistently maxed out
- Performance issues persist after optimization
- Hardware failures (battery, hard drive)

## Hardware Request Process

1. Submit ticket with performance metrics
2. Manager approval required
3. Backup data to OneDrive/network drive
4. Schedule device swap with IT
