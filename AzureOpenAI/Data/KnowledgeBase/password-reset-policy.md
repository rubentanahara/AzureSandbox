# Password Reset Policy and Procedure

## Overview

This document outlines the standard procedure for password resets in our organization.

## Self-Service Password Reset

1. Users can reset their own passwords through the self-service portal at https://portal.company.com
2. Requires verification via registered email or phone number
3. Must meet complexity requirements: minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character

## IT Support Password Reset

1. User must verify identity by providing employee ID and answer to security question
2. Temporary password will be sent to registered email
3. User must change password on first login

## Security Considerations

- Passwords expire every 90 days
- Cannot reuse last 5 passwords
- Account locks after 5 failed login attempts
- Locked accounts automatically unlock after 30 minutes or can be manually unlocked by IT

## Escalation

If user cannot access email or phone for verification, escalate to Tier 2 support for manual identity verification.
